 - Chevee Dodd

VERSION INFORMATION
-------------------
0.1.1 - added credentials.cml file handler separating credentials from log
0.1.0 - Initial commit


Developmental version only.  I'm not responsible for damages.


FEATURES
--------

Offers Google Calendar event adding through simple command line interface.
Uses base64 encodig for username/password stored in credentials file as well
as logging.


NOTES
-----

This is currently a personal project that is not intended to replace Google CLI
or any other tool.  It is a learning experience as I return to coding.  There
are parts of the code that are poorly written and I gladly accept feedback.

In the future, I hope to include:
  - error handling (currently there is exactly zero)
  - passable argument for multiple calendar support (or a menu)
  - intelligent date/time processing that accepts multiple input formats
  - automatic log generation if none is present
  - automatic log control for oversize logs or by date


LICENSE

This project is officially Do With It What You Will.  If you do want to work on
it, I'd appreciate help, otherwise, if you find anything useful in here, have
at it.  I'd like credit, if you feel like giving it to me.


INSTALL
-------
You must have the Google Calendar API for Python installed.
  http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/downloads/list

1. copy gc2.py to any directory
2. mkdir /data in working directory
3. create empty work.log file in /data
4. create credentials.cml in /data.  Each set of credentials must be three
   lines.  The first line of a set will be the identifier in all caps.  The
   second and third lines will be the login and password respectively, both
   encoded in base64.  (note: indentation not required)
