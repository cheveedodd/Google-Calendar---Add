Google Calendar Add Event
 - Chevee Dodd 2011
 e: cheveedodd at gmail dot com

! IMPORTANT !
-------------
This version of Add and Get runs against v2.0 of Google's API.  Google has
introduced v3.0 as of 11/04/2011 and deprecated v2.  I am working on a build
using the new API but this one will work for as long as Google supports v2.

VERSION INFORMATION
-------------------
0.1.2 - added check for data structure and build directory if not present
      - build credentials.cml with user input email/password pair
0.1.1 - added credentials.cml file handler separating credentials from log
0.1.0 - Initial commit


Developmental version only.  I'm not responsible for damages.


FEATURES
--------

Offers Google Calendar event adding through simple command line interface.
Uses base64 encodig for username/password stored in credentials file as well
as logging.


NOTES
-----

This is currently a personal project that is not intended to replace Google CLI
or any other tool.  It is a learning experience as I return to coding.  There
are parts of the code that are poorly written and I gladly accept feedback.

In the future, I hope to include:
  - error handling (currently there is exactly zero)
  - passable argument for multiple calendar support (or a menu)
  - intelligent date/time processing that accepts multiple input formats
  - automatic log control for oversize logs or by date
