-------------------

Initial commit - 0.1.0

Developmental version


FEATURES
--------

Offers Google Calendar event adding through simple command line interface.
Uses base64 encodig for username/password stored in individual log files.


NOTES
-----

This is currently a personal project that is not intended to replace Google CLI
or any other tool.  It is a learning experience as I return to coding.  There
are parts of the code that are poorly written and I gladly accept feedback.

In the future, I hope to include:
  - error handling (currently there is exactly zero)
  - passable argument for multiple calendar support (or a menu)
  - intelligent date/time processing that accepts multiple input formats
  - automatic log generation if none is present
  - automatic log control for oversize logs or by date

This project is officially Do With It What You Will.  If you do want to work on 
it, I'd appreciate help, otherwise, if you find anything useful in here, have at
it.  If you make a ton of money, I'd like some credit...
